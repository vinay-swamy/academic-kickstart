abstract: De novo transcriptome construction from short-read RNA-seq is a common method
  for reconstructing previously annotated and novel mRNA transcripts within a given
  sample. However, this process lacks a way to be evaluated as it is difficult to
  obtain a ground-truth measure of transcript expression. With advances in third generation
  sequencing, full length transcripts of whole transcriptomes can be accurately sequenced
  to generate a ground-truth transcriptomeâ€” but it is significantly more expensive
  than short-read sequencing. We generated long-read Pacbio and short-read Illumina
  RNA sequencing data from an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigmented
  epithelium (iPSC-RPE) cell line. We use the long-read data to identify simple but
  powerful metrics for assesing de novo transcriptome construction and to optimize
  a short-read based de novo transcriptome construction pipeline. We then apply this
  this pipeline to construct transcriptomes for 340 short-read RNA-seq samples originating
  from healthy adult and fetal retina, cornea, and RPE to generate the first pan-eye
  transcriptome annotation. We identify hundreds of novel gene isoforms and examine
  their significance in the context of ocular development and disease.Competing Interest
